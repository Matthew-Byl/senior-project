This is a unit and speed testing framework for OpenCL.

Objective: Enable TDD with OpenCL code.

Tester, iteration 1: only correctness.
======================================
-Input: (1) Input data, (2) Output to compare against, (3) Source code for kernel, (3) Configuration
-Either read from a config file or be a class itself.
	-Advantage of class: parts that need customization can be overloaded.
	-But have a command line version too (runopencl). This will be useful as a way to run an OpenCL kernel on the command line in general.

JUnit: setUp(), tearDown()

Sequence:
  (1) Set up buffers. Can generate this programmatically or read them from files.
  (2) For each platform and device,
     a) Set up
     b) Compile the 
     b) Copy input buffers
     c) Set kernel arguments
     d) Run the ndrangekernel
