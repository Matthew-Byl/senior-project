This project will be organized into directories per stage in the simulation.
Each of the steps is completely independent.

There will be a tests directory in each subfolder with the tests for the
  functions used therein.
There will be a test for every significant function.

This project should be compilable using Visual Studio, so we can optimize
  it. That means no C++11, sadly.

Everything needs to be so obvious that beginning coders can understand
  what's going on.
