In this phase, agents extract resources.

Inputs
======
(1) Configuration object
(2) The amount of each resource each agent has
(3) The amount of experience with each resource each agent has

Kernel Design
=============
Each agent corresponds to one resource. This will put a 256-resource
  limit on the simulation, because one workgroup can be up to 256
  threads.

1. Copy
  a) The amount of each resource the agent has
  b) The amount of experience with each resource the agent has
  to local memory.
2. While there is time remaining in the day:
  -Compute GPM for each resource
  -Compute the time it will take to extract each resource
  -Extract the one with the highest GPM that there is enough time to
    extract. (Local thread 0 does this)
  -Decrement the amount of time left in the day by that amount.
  -Update experience for that resource.
3. Copy amounts and experience back to global memory.
