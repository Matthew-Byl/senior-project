Strategy:
 -Randomly pair agents by generating a random permutation on the CPU and
   transferring that to the GPU.
 -The random permutaion allows each to randomly be agent A and agent B,
   so we don't need more randomness for that.
 -Dimensions: (resources)x(pair of agents)
 -configurable number of trading rounds

Functions I'll need:
 -n-minimum (for 5 least valuable resources)
 -maximum that might not use all threads (to find the pair with highest internal valuation)
   -for pairs, we could have 1 thread per possible pair. This would mean that the "menu"
    can be up to 16, because sqrt(256) = 16.
