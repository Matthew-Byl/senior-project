Instead of objects that are agents, there are buffers in memory for each agent.
  -One GPU has 3GB of memory, (which will take about 0.5s to transfer over PCIe).
  -Therefore, any one step cannot use more than 3GB of memory at once.
  -It will probably work best to use "batches" the same way the Minimax player does.
  -The logic will be faster when using a bunch of similar agents (?)

Since moving data around will be the slow part, and we need to log, we should
  have a separate thread do the logging. Anything that doesn't need to be used
  anymore should be logged and forgotten.
 -Logged things don't need to have very much structure. We can have a separate
   program that reconstitutes what happened from the logs.
