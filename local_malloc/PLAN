Passing around pointers to local memory to use as scratch for
algorithms sucks. There should be a way to allocate and deallocate
scratch as necessary with a tool like malloc().

So we will do some fake static analysis to find out how much memory
is allocated, by what, at what time, and use that information to
allocate a buffer of minimum size at the beginning of the kernel
and hand out scratch space as needed.

__local void *local_malloc( int unique_id, size_t size );
void free( int unique_id );

How it might work:
(1) Find out how much memory is needed at what time.
	-Compile and run the kernel on the CPU with tons of local
	 memory. Make malloc() and free() verbose, and catch the
	 output.
	-All conditionals will need to be ineffective.
 	-Make the condition that any malloc() has to be of a size
	 computed at compile, not run time. This way, we don't need
	 to actually run any code.

(2) Run an algorithm to pack the needed blocks of memory at the
	same time in such a way that minimizes the memory usage but
	doesn't create fragmentation.
	-Probably 99% of the time, the oldest malloc will live the longest
	 (there won't be odd overlappings of lifetimes), so a naive
	 first-alloc comes before next alloc in memory will be fairly
	 efficient.

(3) Generate a source file that returns the correct addresses
	for malloc() with a given id. At runtime, free() won't do anything.
