Building this library:
======================
You will need a copy of LLVM and Clang. I compiled against LLVM and Clang 3.2; other versions
might have a slightly different API and require modifications to this library.

In the Makefile, set LLVM_SRC_PATH and LLVM_BUILD_PATH to the correct locations for your
LLVM build. Depending on the flags you gave when configuring LLVM, you may need to
adjust LLVM_BIN_PATH to Release+Asserts instead of Debug+Asserts.

The public interface to the library is the LocalMallocRewriter class. See the example
 in the examples/ directory for usage.
