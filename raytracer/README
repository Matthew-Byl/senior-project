What I promised Plantinga:

Prof. Plantinga,

We talked about how an OpenCL raytracer would be sufficient as an honors project. Here's what I think a reasonably-sized project would include:

    Cube, sphere, and plane geometries
    Coloured and mirrored surfaces
    Optional fog for distance
    Saving in some well-known graphics format like PNG

I propose a due date of Dec. 14, since that will let me use some otherwise dead time during exam week to work on it.

Does this sound reasonable? Do we have to do any paperwork yet?

John,

Yes, that sounds appropriate. I would add some kind of real-time display of a changing environment, if possible -- simply generating a ray-traced scene in a fraction of a second doesn't make for a very interesting demonstration.

Prof. Plantinga
