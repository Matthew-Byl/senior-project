OpenCL Mankalah Player
======================
The Makefile will build two executables:
	kalah: play a game of Mankalah between 2 players.
	opencl_player_tests: run the unit and fuzz tests of the OpenCL player.

To change the search depth, change the values in depths.h.

The board evaluation function is fairly simple, and can be improved upon.
	This function is found in evaluate.c.
